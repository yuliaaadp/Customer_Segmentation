# Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is the process by which we divide our customers up based on common
characteristics (demographics, behaviour, etc). The objective of customer segmentation is to
market those customers more effectively. The customer segments could be used to create a persona, 
a personification of a customer segment, that could be used to understand the customer’s needs better.

The rule of customer segmentation by their behaviour
1. Recency
2. Frequency
3. Monetary

Customer segmentation is not just important, but vital, in order to optimize our marketing strategies, 
maximize a customer’s value, and improve customer experience. 
Also, to make sure our communication are both effective and appropriate.

This model built by KMeans algorithms and used some library in Python, there are:

Created some analysis and find insights from the database to help understand
the customer behaviour, when the highest sale, which product is the most popular, etc.
